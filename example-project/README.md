# example jsonnet project
This example is themed after an amusement park. The config is fictitious, but provides a complete example to simulate isolation of concerns, and/or jsonnet packages in a larger project.

Notes on this amusement park

- It's really boring - the only attraction is a single waterpark
- There are numerous hotdog stands, and the owners seem to customize each, but only a little bit
